Installation
===============

LedgerAnalytics requires Python ``>= 3.11``, and
can be downloaded from PyPI using:

..  code:: bash

    python3.11 -m pip install ledger-analytics

As standard, we'd recommend installing ``ledger-analytics``
in a virtual environment, or using a package manager like
``uv``.

You can also install directly from Github using SSH access:

..  code:: bash

    python3.11 -m pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/LedgerInvesting/ledger-analytics

If you want to install the developer dependencies, you can use:

..  code:: bash

    python3.11 -m pip install 'ledger-analytics[dev]'
