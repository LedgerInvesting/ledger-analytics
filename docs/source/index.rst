LedgerAnalytics Python
===========================

LedgerAnalytics Python is the Python interface to `Ledger Investing <ledgerinvesting.com>`_'s
analytics infrastructure. Our analytics API endpoints allow easy access to Ledger's suite of
reliable, scalable and state-of-the-art insurance data science models and data structures.
LedgerAnalytics Python efficiently makes HTTP requests to these endpoints, integrating with
our `lower-level software ecosystem <ecosystem.rst>`_, and handling all the complex
dependencies so you don't have to. Get set up in minutes by `requesting
an API key <apikeys.rst>`_, `installing the package <installation.rst>`_, 
and checking out the `Quick Start <quickstart.rst>`_ page.

..  attention::

   We are currently looking for beta testers!
   If you work in insurance or insurance data science and would
   like to try out our models **for free**, please reach out to
   support@ledgerinvesting.com.
